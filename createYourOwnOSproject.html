# Why ?

Sylvain:
"What advice would you have liked to ear a few years ago ?"

"Falling isn't that bad, it teaches you how to get back up" (among other things)

So...  Go on and create a project on which you can fall down all the time

# LeProjet
### Project Manager (yes, really!)

But you can create your own Todolist manager, your photo gallery and so on...
The utility of the project is not relevant: spending 1 or 2 (or more!) hours a week on it is what matters
... and make it public on GitHub !

???

Oui, mon projet s'appelle "LeProjet", je suis dev, pas marketeux ;)

Actually, try a project with different subjects to work on:
- Authentication (+ OmniAuth !), Roles, BackOffice, Image display/mgnt, File Mgnt, Payment, Background jobs, RealTime (IM ?), I18n, TESTS !, deployment, API communication, Search Engine

OS is BIG help: everything is free !!
- Travis.org for automated tests (and Heroku deploy on success ;) )
- CodeClimate for ... clean code !
- PullReview for... learning to code even cleaner !
- Inch CI for better documentation
...
- REVIEWS !

???

Ce ne sont que des exemples, chaque service existe en plein de versions diff√©rentes

# Oh and it can be your porfolio ;)
- some parts of the project are build in TDD
- I try to reflect my way of "thinking code" in this project
... but it's time limited of course :/
